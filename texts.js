      <h4><span style="color: #660000;"><b>How To Install</b></span></h4>
      <p><b>Desktop</b><br>
        After a user navigates to <i>MyKJV.com,</i> when the page is fully loaded an option will be available to install the app on the user's system. On a desktop system there will be a "+" on the right side of the address bar (Chrome, Brave, Edge, etc.). Click the button and the app will be installed with an icon placed on the user's Desktop. From there the app can be accessed at anytime, offline or online.</p>
      <p><b>Android</b><br>
        On an Android mobile device, upon first visiting the site a popup is normally displayed at the bottom of the screen giving the option to install the app on the user's <i>Home Screen.</i> The install option is also found under the three-dot overflow menu at the top of the screen. Once installed the app icon will be placed on the Android Home Screen where it can be accessed like any other app.</p>
      <p><b>iOS</b><br>
        Navigate to <i>MyKJV.com</i> in Safari. Then tap the 'Share' button, scroll down and tap <i>'Add to Home Screen.'</i> Enter the name for the app then tap add. MyKJV will show up on your home screen like a native iOS app. This capability will likely soon be added to other browsers on iOS such as Chrome.</p>
      <h4><span style="color: #660000;">Navigation</span></h4>
      <p><b>Desktop</b><br>
        Most navigation on the desktop should be fairly intuitive. The clickable icons, bottom tabs, and menu items are self-explanatory. When the cross-references are displayed and the cursor is over a reference, the Bible text will display in a popup window. On click the Bible display will be updated and scrolled to the reference. </p>
      <p><b>Mobile</b><br>
        On mobile touch devices the screen will look slightly different. Chapter navigation will be by left/right swipe instead of tapping. A single tap on a reference will display the text popup; tap anywhere else to close. A double-tap will display the reference in the Bible.</p>
      <p><b>Navigating The Bible</b></p>
      <p>To select a book and chapter to navigate to tap or click the <i>current chapter reference label</i> in the header to open a book grid for selection.</p>
      <p>To change Bible versions click or tap the <i>current Bible abbreviation</i> in the header.</p>
      <p>On desktop and non-touch devices, to view the previous or next chapter without opening the book/chapter selector, press and release the Ctrl key to display two navigation areas. Clicking in an area will display the corresponding chapter. Tap the Ctrl key again to hide.</p>
      <p>The <i>Back Arrow</i> in the <i>Bible Toolbar</i> will cycle through displaying the last five Bible chapters viewed. This is helpful if a reference is clicked in <i>Search,</i> <i>Cross-References</i> or elsewhere and the user desires to return to the initial page.</p>
      <h4>Viewing KJV Notes and Defined Words</h4>
      <p>In the standard KJV text some verses will have red footnote indicators in the text. Tap to view the note (or mouseover on desktop). A short definition for words that are blue in color can be viewed on tap as well. </p>
      <h4>Searching The Bible</h4>
      <p>Under the Search tab a user can search for a word, multiple words, or a phrase, all with optional wildcards.<br>
        <br>
        Search terms can be entered in three ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>By entering the search text into the Entry under the Search tab.</li>
        <li>By selecting, dragging, and dropping a word from a page into the Entry Box.</li>
        <li>By copying/pasting a word into the Entry</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>How to Perform Searches:</b><br>
        <br>
        To search for a single word, simply enter the word and click <i>Go</i> or press the <i>Enter</i> key.<br>
        <br>
        If multiple words are entered separated by a space, MyKJV will search for ALL of the words in in verse ("AND" search).<br>
        <br>
        If a pipe symbol (" | ") is entered anywhere in the Entry, MyKJV will search for ANY of the entered words in a verse ("OR" search). For example <i>born | again</i> (or <i> | born again</i>) will find verses that have <i>either word</i> in them.<br>
        <br>
        If quotation marks are around words, the exact phrase will be searched for. i.e. <i>"born again"</i> will search only for that exact phrase. (Punctuation in the Bible text is ignored).</p>
      <p>If a ^ symbol is entered with text the words will be searched for in order i.e <i>holy ^ ghost.</i> (Only two words can be used with this method).</p>
      <p>If a &gt; symbol is entered after a Bible book or book range, only the specified range will be searched. The abbreviations "ot" and "nt" can be used as well. i.e. ot &gt; holy; Psa &gt; peace; Mat-Joh &gt; mercy, etc.</p>
      <p>Phrases and single words can be combined, such as, <i>"born again" regeneration</i>.<br>
        <br>
        Wildcards can be used in conjunction with entered text. The Asterisk "*" acts as any unknown character(s) or no character. For example entering <i>right*</i> will find all words that begin with "right" ("righteous," etc.) Entering <i>*right </i>will find all words that end with "right" ("birthright," etc.)<br>
        <br>
        With the search results there is a concise multi-colored hit display that shows how the results are spread throughout the Bible. Each bar represents a Bible book and on mouseover will display the book name and number of search hits. When a bar is clicked or tapped, the display will scroll to that book in the results list.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Hints:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li> Words found in the search results can themselves be used as search terms by dragging and dropping into the Entry.</li>
        <li> Wildcards can be used in combination with multiple word searches, i.e. <i>etern* everl*</i> will find "eternal," "eternity," "everlasting," etc.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Marking and Copying Verses</h4>
      <p>Double-tapping anywhere on a verse under the Bible and Search tabs will mark the verse for copying. Multiple verses within a chapter can be marked in both verse and paragraph display modes. Double-tapping again will unmark a verse. Once the desired verses are marked, open the Dot-Menu and select "Copy Marked." This will copy the verses to the clipboard and unmark them.</p>
      <p><i>Note: Verses will be copied in the order marked.</i></p>
      <h4>User Verse List</h4>
      <p>Marked verses from the Bible and Search pages can also be sent to a user Verse List from the Dot Menu. They will be inserted in the list in the order marked and the list can hold up to 30 verses. Insertions beyond 30 will cause the oldest verses at the top of the list to be removed.</p>
      <p>Verses in the Verse List can be individually copied to the clipboard or removed using the appropriate buttons on the page. The Verse List content is saved between MyKJV sessions. </p>
      <p><b>Dual View</b></p>
      <p>Clicking the + button on the toolbar will open a new Bible view panel at the bottom of the screen. This new panel can be navigated independently. Scrolling sync is locked by default and can be unlocked with the button on the lower toolbar. When the KJV 1611 edition is loaded in the bottom panel the <i>Change Font</i> button can be toggled to show the text in a <i>Blackletter</i> font styled after the original 1611 printing. </p>
      <p><b>Devotion and Library Books</b></p>
      <p>The device must be online to access Devotion and Library book data. Tap the Select header in either page to view the available titles.</p>
      <p><b>View Text of References in Custom Link</b></p>
      <p>If MyKJV.com is accessed with properly a formatted link, the Bible text of references within the link can automatically be loaded to the Topics Page.</p>
      <p>For instance, this link will load the text Genesis 3:15 and John 3:16-18,<br>
        https://www.mykjv.com/index.html?list=gen3:15,joh3:16-18</p>
      <p>Requirements for custom link,</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The string "https://www.mykjv.com/index.html?list=" must precede the string of references</li>
        <li>There must not be any spaces in the references</li>
        <li>References can be upper or lower case (i.e. Gen, gen)</li>
        <li>References must be comma separated with no space (i.e. "gen3:15,joh3:16-18,rom4:5")</li>
        <li>Spans of references in the same chapter can be included (i.e. joh 3:16-18)</li>
        <li>Bible book abbreviations must be the <b>first three characters</b> of the book, such as "gen," "psa," "2Ti," etc., with two exceptions,</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Judges must be "jdg" ("Jud" conflicts with Jude)</li>
          <li>Philemon must be "phm" ("Phi" conflicts with Phillipians)</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <p style="text-align: center;"> <b>An Installable Web App To Celebrate<br>The King James Bible</b></p>

      <h4><span style="color: #660000;"><b>Overview</b></span></h4>
      <p>MyKJV is a King James Bible "web app" that utilizes the new <i>Progressive
          Web App</i> concept making apps installable on practically
        any device using a recent browser. <i>Progressive (or Universal) Web
          Apps</i> can work offline as well as online. Once installed, no internet connection is required for
        the Bible features. It will behave much like any other installed app
        from an online store. (The <i>Devotion</i> and <i>Library</i>
        features do require online access to function.)</p>
      <h4><span style="color: #660000;"><b>About</b></span></h4>
      <p>MyKJV was developed to celebrate the majesty of the English Bible. Not
        only is the King James Version the word of God, it represents the pinnacle of
        the English language. MyKJV displays two editions of the King James
        Bible: the standard 1769 edition (with footnotes and select defined
        words) that is used and printed today, plus the original 1611 edition as
        it came from the printer. The 1611 edition was painstakingly hand typed
        and proof read (twice!) by a dedicated brother who loves the King James
        Bible. In addition, another dedicated individual spent a great deal of
        time replicating the exact Blackletter font used in the original 1611
        edition and it is included here as well.</p>
      <p>The MyKJV app was developed by the publisher of <i>Bible Analyzer
          Software</i> to offer free and convenient access to the King James
        Bible for everyone. We hope to add more features as the Lord allows, but
        it will always remain a completely free Bible app. </p>
      <p>May the Lord bless you as you read, study, and consult His pure word.</p>
      <p>(If you are interested in a full-featured desktop application for <i>Windows,
          Macintosh, and Linux,</i> consider our free <a href="https://bibleanalyzer.com"
