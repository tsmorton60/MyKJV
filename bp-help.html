    <p>Overview</p>
    <p>MyKJV is a King James Bible "web app" that utilizes a recently developed
      technology that makes web apps installable on practically any device with
      a current browser. These apps are called <i>Progressive Web Apps</i>
      because they can work online, partially online, and completely offline.
      MyKJV will fully function in all three modes. </p>
    <p>When a user visits the MyKJV web page he can use the app in his browser
      like any other web app or web page while online, but if he would like to
      have an even richer and more convenient experience, he can install the app
      on his system, whether desktop, tablet, or phone, for full offline use.
      Once installed it will behave much like any other installed app from an
      online store.</p>
